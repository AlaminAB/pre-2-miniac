                        <strong>today’s students can turn a boiling hot dorm room icy cold… in just a matter of

                    <p><strong>They’ve invented the world’s coldest portable AC</strong>… and after months of testing,
                        and the incredible reaction from the public, this Hong Kong team is bringing their incredible
                        invention to the United States for the first time.</p>
                    <p>My son is in college right now, and he often complains about the unbearable heat in his dorm
                        room. So I decided to gift him with a&nbsp;<a href="#">Blaux Mini Portable AC</a> of his own.

                    <p>My son doesn’t really complain about much. We didn’t have much money when he was growing up, so
                        he was used to making do with less than perfect conditions. He’s a real trooper that way.</p>
                    <p><strong>But even he couldn’t stand the way his dorm would heat up in the summer months.</strong>
                        It was one thing for his dorm to be hot all day. He pretty much accepted that as an unpleasant
                        fact of life.</p>
                    <p>But what really bothered him was how that old dorm building of his would retain heat. Even when
                        the night had fallen and it had cooled down outdoors, his dorm was still boiling hot inside.</p>
                    <p>It was like an oven in there, making the nights in his dorm just as hot as the daytimes were. He
                        told me he had started doing his studies on a bench outside of his dorm at night, just because
                        the heat indoors never went away.</p>

                    <p>Of course, I wasn’t going to send just any AC unit to my son. I did a lot of research, and most
                        of the so-called “portable AC units” you can buy are little more than glorified fans. They can
                        produce some cold air, but if you don’t have your face crammed right into the unit, you can
                        barely even feel it.</p>
                    <p>That’s what’s so great about the&nbsp;<a href="#">Blaux Portable AC</a> unit. <strong>Hong Kong
                            can have some famously hot weather, with temperatures as high as 85 degrees, even at
                            night.</strong> So the engineers in Hong Kong really had their work cut out for them.</p>

                        <p>The engineers in Hong Kong realized that a “one size fits all” approach to air conditioning
                            was not acceptable. They quickly realized that <strong>some people prefer just a slight
                                cooling, while others really want to bring on the chill!</strong> So they made their AC
                            unit feature three different cooling modes, so you can set it to produce the exact amount of
                            cooling you desire. And the unit has adjustable blades, too, so you can point your cool
                            blast of air in any direction you choose!</p>

                        <p>Featuring a high capacity <strong>2000 mAh Battery</strong>, the Blaux Portable AC unit can
                            be <strong>recharged from any USB outlet.</strong> And since the unit is <strong>completely
                                wireless</strong>, you’re not stuck next to the electrical outlet, so you can take it
                            wherever you need it most (even outdoors!). And of course, the <strong>Blaux Portable AC
                                comes with its own charging cable</strong> included with every order.</p>

                        <p>The engineers in Hong Kong quickly realized that they needed to create a device that you
                            didn’t need to be an engineer to operate! <strong>So one of their top design goals was to
                                make the unit easy enough for anybody to use. You simply fill it with water and turn it
                                on!</strong> Then set the fan level you desire, and you’re done!</p>

                        <p>Needless to say, <strong>nobody wants an AC unit that is huge, ugly, or takes up a lot of
                                space</strong> – especially in an already-cramped dorm room. That’s why the Hong Kong
                            engineers made the Blaux Portable AC compact and appealing to look at. It fits in perfectly
                            with any kind of décor, and is a perfect complement to any home, dorm, or apartment.</p>

                            disturbed the studying habits of students! <strong>So the engineers who designed the Blaux
                                Portable AC unit made sure to make the device as quiet as possible.</strong> You can’t
                            even hear it unless you’re really listening out for it!</p>

                    he was now <strong>relaxing comfortably in a perfectly-chilled room</strong> – even at high noon!
                    And even better, he told me the&nbsp;<a href="#">Blaux AC</a> unit had allowed him to <strong>sleep

                            I tell you, <strong>people have gone CRAZY over this little AC unit.</strong> Please email

                        decided to order one for myself.</strong> Let me tell you, it really is amazing. I plugged mine
                    in and was blasted with a stream of ice-cold air. Not “cool” air, mind you – <strong>we’re talking
                        ice cold air.</strong> In fact, it was so cold, I had to turn it down to the lowest setting.</p>
                <p>I thought the&nbsp;<a href="#">Blaux Portable AC</a> unit would be the perfect gift for my son, but I
                    had no idea how great it would be for me, too! I do woodworking in the garage, but without AC it’s
                    just too hot to work in there in the summer. <strong>But with the</strong> <a href="#">Blaux

                <p>I can’t believe such a small unit can push out so much cold air, and at such an amazingly affordable
                    price! My electricity bills have plummeted, and I can make any room in the house as cool as an
                    icebox!</p>

                          <p class="oponion">I live in a rent controlled apartment, and my rent is so low I can’t afford to move anywhere else. Unfortunately, the AC in my apartment building totally sucks. I was burning up until a friend let me try out his Blaux Portable AC. Now I’m in love with the thing! I’d pay ten times the price for comfort like this, and no, I’m not kidding.</p>

                          <p class="oponion">My job requires travel to all sorts of small towns, and I often get stuck in hotels and motels that don’t have AC or the AC is virtually pointless. I can’t afford to show up to meetings looking sweaty and disheveled, so for me, the Blaux AC unit is a total lifesaver! And I love the fact that I can charge it over any USB connection!</p>
